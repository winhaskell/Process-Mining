Process mining techniques allow for extracting information from event logs. 
For example, the audit trails of a workflow management system or the transaction logs of an enterprise resource 
planning system can be used to discover models describing processes, organizations, and products. Moreover,
it is possible to use process mining to monitor deviations (e.g., comparing the observed events with 
predefined models or business rules in the context of SOX).
